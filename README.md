How Auction House Works?
A "LOT" is a single object or collection of goods that will be auctioned together. Every lot has a reserve price that cannot be lowered.
Individual lots are put up for sale by sellers by leaving their belongings at the auction warehouse as long as two weeks before to the event. Workers at the warehouse complete a form with the seller's name and address, as well as the lot description, reserve price, and auction date for each item. As lots arrive, the warehouse employees assign lot numbers.
